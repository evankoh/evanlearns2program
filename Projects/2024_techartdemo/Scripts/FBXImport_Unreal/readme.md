# FBX Import Python Tool for Unreal Engine 5.3.2

## A Python Tool to aid users in automating the importing process of static and skeletal meshes into Unreal Engine projects.

This Python Tool was created with the intention of allowing users to:

* Call Python Tool from Custom Menu created in another Python Tool (please see https://github.com/evankoh/evanlearns2program/tree/main/Projects/2024_techartdemo/Scripts/Custom_Menu_Tutorial)
* Prompt user to input file path of static / skeletal meshes to import into project
* Prompt user to select between importing static or skeletal meshes (the import settings differs depending on the selection)
* Automation of import for meshes in FBX files located in file path provided
* Automation of the creation of individual folders for every FBX file imported within the 'Meshes' folder of the Content Browser

## Access relevant files for tool flow and logic

* Process of creating code documented on my wordpress: https://evanpython.wordpress.com/
