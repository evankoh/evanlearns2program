# Cookie Game Project

## A decision-based text game whereby you play as a small kid attempting to get to the cookie jar at the top of the kitchen cabinet!

This project is my first attempt at making a game using Python ever since I started learning Python last August 2023. This code is written with the intention of practising how to:

* Create a design flow chart
* Create a UML class diagram
* Create a playable decision-based text Python game
* Import modules from Python and sys to be used in game
* Create classes, parent classes and child classes
* Using global and local variables to lock and unlock routes
* Code classes to interact and affect one another
* Prompt player to give inputs to reach the objective of the game

## Access relevant files for game flow and logic
* Design flow chart: cookiegame_designflowchart.drawio.png
* UML class diagram: cookiegame_UMLclassdiagram.drawio.png
* Process of creating game documented on my wordpress: https://evanpython.wordpress.com/

## How to run game (for Windows):
1. Download cookiegame.py
2. If you have Python3 and Windows PowerShell installed on your machine:
* Open Windows PowerShell from your windows search
* Change directory (write cd before pasting the directory path) to the directory you have saved the file to (e.g. cd D:\Admin\Python\pythonlearning\Projects\2024_cookiegame)
* Enter this line: python cookiegame.py
3. If you do not have Python installed on your machine (or any shells and compilers):
* Open cookie.py in notepad
* Select-All (Ctrl+A), copy (Ctrl+C)
* Go to this website on your browser: https://www.online-python.com/
* Paste (Ctrl+V) the code into the main.py box
* Click run

## How to edit this project for your own use

As this is my first project to test my capabilities and understanding of Python, you may download the python file and edit it for your own purposes.
