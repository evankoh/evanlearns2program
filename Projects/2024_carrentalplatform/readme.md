# Car Rental Platform Project

## A car rental platform text-based project that allows user to rent cars based on a hourly, daily or weekly basis and return said cars and the platform will generate a bill based on the rental.

An assignment project where I was tasked to build an online car rental platform using Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) in Python. This code is written with the intention of showcasing my understanding of OOP in Python to allow users to:

* Rent cars from any one of the following options: hourly, daily, or weekly rental.
* Free to choose any number of cars they want, provided the number of available cars is more than the number of requested cars.

The objective of the assignment is to be able to:

* Import and use built-in module DateTime to handle the rental time and bill.
* Create relevant classes to perform said tasks such as renting cars and returning cars.
* Define methods in classes to perform functions such as displaying available cars and generating the final bill.
* Allow users to provide inputs and inputs will be received and processed to generate the respective outputs.

## Access relevant files for game flow and logic

* Process of creating game documented on my wordpress: https://evanpython.wordpress.com/
