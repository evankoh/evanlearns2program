# Car Rental Platform Project

## A car rental platform text-based project that allows user to rent cars based on a hourly, daily or weekly basis and return said cars and the platform will generate a bill based on the rental.

An assignment project where I was tasked to build an online car rental platform using Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) in Python. This code is written with the intention of showcasing my understanding of OOP in Python to allow users to:

* Rent cars from any one of the following options: hourly, daily, or weekly rental.
* Free to choose any number of cars they want, provided the number of available cars is more than the number of requested cars.

The objective of the assignment is to be able to:

* Import and use built-in module DateTime to handle the rental time and bill.
* Create relevant classes to perform said tasks such as renting cars and returning cars.
* Define methods in classes to perform functions such as displaying available cars and generating the final bill.
* Allow users to provide inputs and inputs will be received and processed to generate the respective outputs.

* Process of creating code documented on my wordpress: https://evanpython.wordpress.com/

## How to run code (for Windows):
1. Download Carrental.py
2. If you have Python3 and Windows PowerShell installed on your machine:
* Open Windows PowerShell from your windows search
* Change directory (write cd before pasting the directory path) to the directory you have saved the file to (e.g. cd D:\Admin\Python\pythonlearning\Projects\2024_carrentalplatform)
* Enter this line: Carrental.py
3. If you do not have Python installed on your machine (or any shells and compilers):
* Open Carrental.py in notepad
* Select-All (Ctrl+A), copy (Ctrl+C)
* Go to this website on your browser: https://www.online-python.com/
* Paste (Ctrl+V) the code into the main.py box
* Click run

## How to edit this project for your own use

As this is an assignment to test my capabilities and understanding of Python, you may download the python file and edit it for your own purposes and analysis.

## Known issues

The following issues are due to the nature of the assignment, as I worked within the assignment's brief and did not do any additional adjustments to the code. However, I have identified areas where the platform can be improved based on user-experience and written down the known issues and how I would improve the platform if I were to continue working on it:
* Platform does not save outputs generated from customer's inputs (e.g. quantity of cars, rental time and rental type) and auto-generates the bill after the rental is complete. In a more refined code, the data should be stored in variable(s) and customers can retrieve said data without needing to return cars automatically.
* Platform does not allow customers to rent different types of cars, only allows for the rental of one type of car at any given time. In a more refined code, customers should be able to rent multiple types of cars and not be restricted to only one.
* Platform does not allow customers to extend their rental time if they wish to, only allowed to return rented cars upon rental completion. In a more refined code, customers should be able to extend their rental time and have this change reflected in the final bill when they return the cars.
* Platform does not have the capability for customers to return their cars late and have it reflected in their final bill, as the return of cars is automatically prompted after rental completion. In a more refined code, platform should be able to take note of the time that the customer rents the cars and the time where they return said cars; which will then identify if the rental is overdue and generate the final bill accordingly.
