Hey, animator!
Thank you for downloading our pretty Lou rig. 

Rig is distributed "as is".
It based on AdvancedSkeleton rigging system. 
You can check out animation with Lou on vimeo channel https://vimeo.com/boristheartist
You can use it in any non-commercial projects. Feel free to modify rig, model and textures as you wish.

Model by Dmitry Danilov 	www.artstation.com/dmitrodanilov
Rig by Boris Klimov		vimeo.com/boristheartist

To do list:
- speed up the rig (now it is slow)
- add a few more blendshapes
- make a picker
- integrate this rig into official AdvancedSkeleton installer 

Tips and Tricks:
- FKHead_M  holds  additional face controllers attributes that are hidden by default
- Main root controller holds Bend controllers vis. attribute
- To hide polygons under the cloth use "Geo Under Hide" attribute on Main controller
ps. I will update this README and rig with new versions. If you have any questions and suggestions please mail me: klimov@november17.art
